# Language-Identification
 Language identification in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the task of automatically determining the language in which a given text is written. Tokenization breaks the text into manageable pieces, making it easier to analyze. After tokenization, features are extracted from the text.After tokenization, features are extracted from the text. These features could include statistical properties of the text, frequency of certain characters or words, and other linguistic characteristics. These features help in distinguishing between languages.Language identification models are often trained on large datasets containing examples of text in different languages. These datasets are used to teach the model the patterns and characteristics associated with each language.
# Performance Metrics
The performance of a language identification model is evaluated using a separate dataset that it hasn't seen during training. Common metrics include precision, recall, and F1 score, which measure the model's ability to correctly identify languages and avoid misclassifications.
